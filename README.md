## Hi, welcome to accountabubble.

accountabubble is a productivity tracker designed for groups for people as opposed to individual use.

Our goal was to create something that promotes productivity and progress while still fostering a sense of community.

If you click [here](https://www.figma.com/file/TXE6KpD0hn5uJkiQiBa8kV/accountabubble?node-id=0%3A1), that'll send you to our Figma prototype which has an annotated and laid out flow of the whole app.

Once you're done with that, if you wanted to click around with the weekly overview screen and see how the progress bar responds to various tasks being checked off, here is a [website](https://calvem2.github.io/accountabubble/), created with React, that lets you see an interactive version of that feature. 


We hope you enjoy!
